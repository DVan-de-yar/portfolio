### list of skills:
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Mysql
* Object oriented programming(OOP) in python
* Matplotlib

I use the skills listed above to load data sets into an idle or jupyter notebook. With this loaded data I can do data preprocessing and analysis to clean the data, which  will give the data a more uniform structure and allow me to understand how different aspects of the data effect one another or how certain aspects in the data can result in different outputs. 
With this understanding matplotlib can be used to create visualizations that will enable people to interpret the information better . Finally , Mysql is used for database creation and manipulation by adding a local database to store, remove and extract information.

### Projects
One of my first projects was to do an Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a automobile data set . The data was loaded,preprocessed and then analysised to try to find out what aspects of a vehicle gave it a higher sale value, and which aspects gave vehicles low sale values. Data visualizations were created to display this information.

Another of my projects was to do a EDA on a renewal energy data set which after loading and preprocessing showed what forms of renewable energy was used in South Africa during the time in which the information was recorded as well as the energy output for each form of renewable energy. With this information I wrote functions to calculate the average power output of each renewable energy resource and made recommendations as to where they should be built based on which natural resource the energy would be drawn from.

One of my recent projects involved the creation of an Recurrent neural network and use of nlp(natural language processor) to do sentiment analysis on some book reviews, to train the model to determine whether a review was good or bad based on the words in the text.
